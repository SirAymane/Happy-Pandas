# Introduction

The following document aims to show the main results of the first practice of M14 - Bioinformatics.

The topic of the essay is about processing and analyzing health related data in order to produce a technical scientific report of the findings.

In our case, we choose as the principal dataset the count of weekly deaths registered in the geographical units of European Union. In order to analyze properly this dataset, we also need to use demographic data (population counts) and catalogues of the geographical european unit entities (NUTS).

All the data comes from Eurostat and can be accessed with the following links:

Weekly deaths by sex, age (by 5) and NUTS-3: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/estat-navtree-portlet-prod/BulkDownloadListing?file=data/demo_r_mweek3.tsv.gz

Population by sex, age (by 5) and NUTS-3: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/estat-navtree-portlet-prod/BulkDownloadListing?file=data/demo_r_pjangrp3.tsv.gz

NUTS 2021 catalogue: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/345175/629341/NUTS2021.xlsx
